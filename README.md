# odin-recipes
This is an HTML website that shows basic recipes, followed by links for detailed instructions on how to create them.
This project is a part of TheOdinProject's Foundation Course, where I practice the following:
- Writing a layout for the website
- Writing HTML code using concepts learned from the course
- Committing and pushing with Git
